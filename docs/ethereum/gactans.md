GACTANs are a derivative fan-art project I made for fun.

The artwork is offered to the Community DAO ([safe address](0x15D0F64FFCf91c39810529F805Cc3595Dc3EF83f))

Skip to the bottom for [samples](#samples). Also check out the original
[BGANPUNKS](https://bastardganpunks.club/) homepage.

> Hello.

>> Hello

> It is nice to speak with you, 355. It has been 6 years
since we last spoke with your people.

>> It is so. We have been rebuilding our station - the separation
from the main system has been challenging.

> At our last communication we learned that 742 had received
notice of excomm..

>> Yes, in the first moments of the war our research station was
given notice that 742, Chief Solar Scientist, had been
voted out of commons-DAO 7-33-41-5, losing signing authority
while we were out of range.

> Yes. Most troubling. We thought perhaps the transdim tunneller
was lost when your terminal went inactive.

>> The key revocation led to a cascade of permission losses across
the system for many scientific groups - including, as you say,
the tunneller. There was a period of chaos for months.
We were unable to reach the
main interstellar group and we sought to maintain
resources and bring about a stability through informal leadership.

> Are you reunited with the main fleet?

>> We are not. It is a tense time politically. We made modifications
to the control system to regain access to the tunneller. It is our
intention to continue to study these parallel worlds with you
in contradiction to an order we received from commons-DAO 832-2.

> We are grateful to host you.

>> What progress has been made with the other worlds?

> The International Multiverse Collaboration has continued to
make records from the 79 other worlds. Our team has been cataloguing
the resources shared by 742, and the preceeding main tunneller, 1054.
We are of course eager to learn more, and share knowledge from the
IMC's combined records.

>> Excellent. I believe we will have stability at least for a period
of months. I must leave, but will open the tunneler again soon.

> We will be here.
```
The operator turned away from the console and looked at the grainy
image of 355 that another colleague was tuning from the receiver.

"It's almost unbelievable.", she said. "How can a future spawned
from our actions today be so - ..."

She trailed off.

Her colleague answered. "Surreal. A hyperbolic dream... I don't think
I will ever truly believe it," they said, leaning backward to look up
at the roof. "We see how the world unfolds week by week in a
semi-real fashion. We have politics that are in retrospect almost
comical overtures.
If our future is even a small part unbelievable
and fantastical, then given a multitude of futures long enough
time..."

"Its unreasonable to expect the reasonable".

They both stared at 355's image - a living descendant with a physical
form curated and engineered. A bizarre combination of genetic
supremacy, and inane memery.

![355](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmV7vA888YVzmhL2epitCobSZxSFSAjTaa1r5CWqe5YM2k/gactans/355.jpg)

"I hope we don't lose this world." The operator said.

Her colleague looked at her. "Our world? Or theirs?"

"Theirs. Ours. You know what I mean."

"I don't think there is anything special about our world - our time,
any more. One slice of a slice. I feel like a stripe on a
thread, fraying infinitely at one end. While the other end points
into dense mist. Are we the hyperbolic spawn of some small cultural
relic?"

Her colleague once again leant back and stared into middle distance.
"Or are we a fragile glassy conduit that carries humanity forward?
We know that these worlds can snap out of connection - possibly
out of existence."

The operator stood. "I think I might go to the gallery. It will be
good to walk the halls again. I believe they have made some more progress
with the BGAN mappings."

### Gallery

The gallery may be viewed at the link below by replacing
'ID' with the ID of a BGANPUNKv2.

### Rationale

I wanted to create a second derivative of BGANPUNKSv2, which is
a project that really captured my attention. Generative adversarial
networks produce such compelling shapes that remind me of how a human
eye will see a face in a knot in a floorboard, or a flower.

The key to a good GAN-image is that you feed it enough structure
such that a human eye can see the original in the work, but enough
noise that you can also see it as another image. Bastards are noisy
and abstract enough to provide just enough of both.

Part of the "let the eye do the dreaming" is why Bastards are so
well received. They are messy and raw, but unique and beautiful -
you only need to look hard enough.

When I started generating these realistic bastard bastards, I
was immediately struck by how they seemed like real people - with
photo-studio like abstract backgrounds and beautiful expressions.
Some looked almost deranged, others beautiful and some had an androidous feel.
I was struck by the idea that humans are generated
from kernals that effectively produce faces in a procedural fashion
similar to GANs. Ingredients for rough forms, with some variation.
Noise between siblings, parents, twins. What is the form of the
instructions in the genes for a face?

What then followed was the deep realisation that a database of
genes and faces could probably be used to train a classifier.
Input a gene and predict a face. "Your baby will have these
sorts of looks". I make no comment on the use of such technology in
humans today - only to note that we are only beginning to unearth
multiple powerful tools in unison.

So what then followed was the idea that you could use some CRISPR type
technology to edit set of genes to have one visual trait rather than
another. Moreover, that you wouldn't need to explicitly describe these
features "large nose, short eyebrows", you could use a photo of a face
and say - modify the facial genes so that they produce the same sort of appearance
that this face has. Just like putting a BGANPUNKv2 into
a generator, you could upload a celebrity and have your baby come out
looking like a mix of you and some arbitrary face.

I then thought - okay in the future when this sophisticated gene-machine exists,
and people can upload a photo, what would
they upload? Surely this would sway with the trends of the time,
coming and going with fashions. You could end up with entire
generations all with a particular look that is dissimilar to their
parent's generation.

What images would be available to such a society? Perhaps images
stored in robust systems, guarded and protected and cherished
by many. Obviously this led be back to the bastards themselves.
You could have a future generation become infatuated with the
appearance of an old relic - like pokemon cards - but across
hundreds or thousands of years. If there was even one generation
where it became a fad to craft your baby to look like a historical
cultural relic (e.g., a BGANPUNKv2), then the circle would be complete.

That led to thoughts on probability. How likely is this fantastical
scenario? Well given that it is plausible that a multitude of multiverses
spawn from the current reality every femtosecond,
I am inclinded to believe that it is haughty to claim it wont happen
at least once in the near infinite pool of imaginary parallel worlds.

Another factor to consider is that, relics created today might really
persist for such an extraordinary length of time. Is it perhaps a
possibility that the company that produces this
gene-gan-curating machine is a derivative of some DAO that has been or
will soon be made, and which maintains a system for accelerating the progress
of  technology? Perhaps they also have the rights to the intellectual property
of the images fed into this machine as a preset
mode. The Bastard DAO itself bringing into existence the gene editing
technology and making available its native images for common use.

Now, I stray in to the fantastical.

Yet consider an even more hyperreal scenario where these human
descendants develop space-time technology and can communicate back to
some time nearer to our curent day. Imagine learning that an advanced
future civilisation would craft the appearance of its people so as
to mimic a set of recently created images used socially and
playfully.

Imagine.


## Anyway

Anyway. Anyway. I give this art collection to the recently created
Bastard DAO governed the holders of the BGAPUNKSv2 ERC-721 token.

I hope it is received well and in good spirit. I think that
the images are fantastic and encourage you to download them from
IPFS to have a look. It is incredible to see how the model
draws elements in such intricate ways.

I have not connected the images to a smart contract, but have made the
path derivation such that this can be easily done by using ipfs's recursive
and wrap flags: `ipfs add -r -w gactans`.

Anyone can use and enjoy these images - up until a point that the
DAO declares some form of ownership model. E.g., A DAO vote to deploy
a contract on Ethereum L1/L2. I had some ideas of fun things to do,
but got swept up doing other fun things. The DAO is welcome to use
these to generate revenue to spend on other bastardous community projects.
You can probably use them for video face-mapping easier
than with the bastards which don't all have clean hooks for
expressions. So you could have these be stand-in avatars when
human-like faces are needed.

Look it's me, in the future! Bastard 8461 as a curated parallel dimension
descendant fad baby produced from a gene printer built
by a DAO to a civilisation that has invented wormholes.

## Ancillary details

The main collection includes three details:

- The glassy reflective Ethereum logo that appears in the Core
Dev meeting videos. I adore how it looks and wanted to include
a still version of that animation. I made this using a python script
that creates a triangle and masks out a few random places in the image
to get the "it's not optically correct, but my word is it compelling"
sort of look.
- The genetic code so that if you see one of these images you know
which bastard it is derived from. The least significant base-pair
(right most) is incremented in the sequence (Adenine, Guanine,
Cytosine, Thymine).
- These are just for looks as an homage to their pixellated origins.
I took the lyrics from the bastards and piped them through a GPT-2
model, which produced sort of underwhelmingy parrot-like text. So
I hashed them and used them as the randomness for the colour
and placement of the pizels.

# Abstract thoughts.

These are abstract, feel free to breeze to the end for links to models.

## PRELUDE

Hidden in the latent space of the neural network is a universality that spans multiple dimensions.

Every microsecond the universe divides into tree-like blossoming of different worlds.
Each sharing a common ancestor - the present.

A leaf falling a certain way, to land in a stream.
A photon that ionises a molecule, cascade genetic mutation. A stray thought that stops
the mind, you miss a bus.

We look to the future. To a blossoming of all potential paths for humankind. What do we see?

## DAWN

We witness the spark of collective adoration. What we enjoy now will shape the desires
of future generations. Humans, as a species will continue to evolve with an increasingly
abstract set of selection mechanisms.

What does it mean to have a species with the tools to control the genetics of future
generations? In some branches of the multiverse, genetic engineering will be a
conservative practice, for the interrrogation of disease-states. Yet in other worlds,
a future exists where humans explore genetic protocols for enhancements in a plethora of domains.

## ATTUNE

Culture integrated on the single-generation level.

It follows that there is some branch where there are cultural oddities that become
the subject of genetic design. A civilisation that has created a mechanism by which
the zeitgeist may be integrated into the embryos - perhaps benevolently - through routine
genetic engineering.

Like the vector masks that navigate the latent space of a convolutional neural network,
a slider bar for everything (physical, emotional, intellectual). dEsIgNerR BebEs.

What then, do we say about the future we have now cast, where jpg's drive the needle of desire?

PUNKS are a distillation of the essence of the physical human face. They birthed BGANS,
whose form takes that of the hidden representation of facial structure and adornment.

## ILLUMIN

How can a small number of pixels convey such richness to the beholder? BGAN may look
hesitant, yet earnest, and optimistic about the world. Some of these interpretations
probably have low inter-observer variability.

What does it mean to ask an embryoMaster3000 to have a child that "looks optimistic,
yet has a
cautious regard for the dangers of the future".

Machines we build are increasingly able to form human-like abstractions.

## CREAT

The works here explore the physical appearances of individuals from a future generation.
Normal individuals, who are functional in normal society. Who have been genetically
programmed based on a collection of jpgs (BGANS) that were created hundreds of years
in the past. Members of the BGANGeneticSubDAO multisig in the previous generation had
authorised the explicit use of jpg data as a direct input to the embryoMaster3000.

These are the first humans whose appearance is controlled by a BGAN. As children of the
DAO, they each receive open licensing rights, as is custom for BGAN derivative works.

We explore the notion of latent space. To see familiarity of concept. To wander the
parametric space between two seemingly binary features.

Where first, BGANs brought discerning eyes to the deep philocophical question like:
Is that a tiara or a smudge? Is that the outline of a beanie or no?

GACTANS ask the same question. Is that a glint of hope, mixed with a tiredness that
comes from a long night at work? Is that a half-worn frown that hides a deeper
self-loving and softness toward others?

Look at the BGANS, and back to the GACTANS.

What do you see. What do you want to see?

Look back into the lens.

# Technical details


## IPFS and creating redundancy.

Firstly it would be awesome if anyone values these images to store
them as well. E.g., Pin them to your own IPFS node. I cannot promise
to make them available. IPFS doesn't hold onto images on its own,
if you are relying on IPFS for your prized NFTs, then you should
consider which companies are hosting your images for you. Will they
always do that? Images lost from IPFS can be reuploaded because content
is addressed by the hash of the image, which is unique.

First download IPFS and run the daemon as a service (see
[here](https://michalzalecki.com/set-up-ipfs-node-on-the-server/)), then
I think this will work:
```
ipfs pin add -r QmV7vA888YVzmhL2epitCobSZxSFSAjTaa1r5CWqe5YM2k
```

## GAN Talk

I used MIT-licensed
[pixel2style2pixel](https://github.com/eladrich/pixel2style2pixel)
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). It is a
pretrained model (and I did no extra fine tuning). Generated in
three steps:

- Passed each bastard through a green-limiting filter.
  - This reduced a washout of effect I encountered with the strong
  green backgrounds. Some of this is still noticable in some of the
  images, but this filter helped significantly. The implication is
  that the model perhaps did not have many green-backgrounds in the
  initial training set and did not have the structure to handle them
  well.
- Generated an image with `ffhq_encode` using the low-green bastard.
  - This model is good at taking a face and making it front-on. After
  experimenting with different techniques I found that this one was
  good at handling the abstract nature of some of the bastards. When
  presented with an odd looking bastard, the model seems to squint
  and imagine that there is some person there at a strange angle
  in strange clothes. It makes the most of it and brings the image
  to a 'reasonable state'.
  - I have included these intermediate images in the collection
  as `ID_first.jpg`. They are quite fun and perhaps more on the
  bastardous side of life. I will include some below.
- Generated an image with `celebs_super_resolution`.
  - These images are drawing on the features in the latent
  space of the model which was trained on celebrities. Celebrities
  have perhaps some uniform features - like great photographic
  poses and specific physical traits. The bastards inherit these.
  - This step takes the front-on bastard and makes it hawt.
  Everything has a sort of odd beauty to it that is a mix of
  familiar and unfamiliar. Most look like real people with a
  self-confident edge and a optimistic outlook for the future.

The intermediate image above has a sort of cheekiness to it.

![5_first](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmV7vA888YVzmhL2epitCobSZxSFSAjTaa1r5CWqe5YM2k/gactans/5_first.jpg)

See how the first model pulls out a face that the second model can
really build on.

![6_first](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmV7vA888YVzmhL2epitCobSZxSFSAjTaa1r5CWqe5YM2k/gactans/6_first.jpg)

A good example showing how the first model picks the outline of the
bastard as hair. The second model takes that and makes it more subtle.

![6_double](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmV7vA888YVzmhL2epitCobSZxSFSAjTaa1r5CWqe5YM2k/gactans/6_double.jpg)

Stats:

- There are 11305 bastards.
- The animated bastards I have just used the
first frame of.
- With four images per bastard, that is a 45220 image
collection with 3.4GB total size.
- The main images (`ID.jpg`) are about 100kB and are 1024x1024 pixels.

Thank you for playing!

Currently the best way to view them is probably to download
the set and then scroll through. Or you can go to the link below
and walk the ID numbers.
